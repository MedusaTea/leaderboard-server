## Summary
A very simple and reusable database and REST server for arbitrary Leardboards and Achievements.

## Heads Up
This isn't 100% completed yet, but it's almost there, i'll have it finished when i come back around to using it soon.
Otherwise, if you're familiar with nodejs and any sql database, you should be able to clone this, peek around and adjust for your use case :)
